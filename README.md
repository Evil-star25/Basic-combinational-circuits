# Basic-combinational-circuits
This repository contains implementations of fundamental combinational logic circuits using Verilog. It is designed as a learning resource for students and beginners in digital design and hardware description language
In addition to these modules, the repository includes various testbenches for basic logic gates  to help users understand their behavior through simulation.

Each design is verified with a dedicated testbench. Contributions and improvements are welcome!
